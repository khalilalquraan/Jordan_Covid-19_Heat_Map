        The covid-19 pandemic also known as the coronavirus pandemic is the
        defining global health crisis of our time, the virus is primarily
        transmitted from person-to-person by coming into contact with an
        infected person’s droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or
        exhales, droplets are expelled and can land in another person’s nose or
        mouth and inhaled into the lungs. The virus can be transmitted by an
        infected person not showing symptoms of illness.
        Because of the seriousness of this pandemic in a fast-evolving pandemic
        it is not a simple matter to identify the area in Jordan that are most, so
        we decided to help the Jordanian government and other audiences to stay
        informed by making our application -covid-19 health map Jordan – to
        track the impact of the pandemic.
        a big problem faced in this period; it makes for the world a lot of
        problems. it is our interest to optimize and customize existing services
        by providing them in a better and easier way and more detailed for the
        Jordan region.
        In our application we will divide Jordan map into several areas and to
        make the Jordanian government and other audiences up to date about
        this pandemic by providing updated information and instructions and
        providing a dynamic interactive heat map about Covid19 in all Jordanian
        regions and making statistics about the pandemic such as the total
        numbers of cases in Jordan and in a specific region, death rates.etc.
